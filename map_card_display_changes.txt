MAP CARD DISPLAY FEATURE - CHANGES APPROVED
============================================

1. Z-INDEX VALUES UPDATED
   - map = 0
   - default small map card pill = 1
   - hover/big map card pill = 2
   - mapmarker icon = 3
   - mapcard thumbnail = 4
   - small map card label = 5
   - big map card label = 6 (future feature)
   - Updated z-index reference table in style.css

2. HOVER PILL IMAGE
   - Changed from 150x40-pill-2f3b73.webp to 225x60-pill-#2f3b73.webp
   - Scales to 150x40 using transform: scale(0.6667)
   - Replaces default pill on hover
   - Preloaded once globally (not per card) for instant hover with no delay
   - Seamless color change with identical sizing (no flicker)

3. THUMBNAIL ON HOVER
   - Thumbnail loads on hover
   - Replaces mapmarker icon only after thumbnail has fully loaded (no flicker)
   - Thumbnail: 30px × 30px, circular (border-radius: 50%), matches mapmarker position exactly
   - Uses object-fit: cover to fill circle properly

4. HOVER_ONLY MODE
   - No map cards preloaded
   - Default pill never seen (small map cards only load when post or mapmarker is hovered/tapped)
   - Cards removed on mouseleave
   - Pill and label only created on hover

5. ALWAYS MODE
   - Small map cards preloaded for visible markers only (not entire world)
   - Cards created for markers in visible map area
   - Updates when map moves/zooms (new markers become visible)

6. REAL-TIME MODE SWITCHING
   - When admin switches between hover_only and always modes:
     * Immediately loads/unloads cards as required
     * Saves setting to database automatically
     * Changes visible immediately without page reload

7. CODE CLEANUP
   - Removed all "expanded" references (feature not yet implemented)
   - Removed CSS rules for .is-expanded and .small-map-card-label-expanded

FILES MODIFIED:
- index.js: Added map card display logic, hover handlers, thumbnail loading
- style.css: Updated z-index values and reference table, removed expanded references

IMPORTANT NOTES:
=================

SMALL MAP CARD CODE LOCATION:
- All small map card modifications are easy to find by locating where the pill image is fetched/created
- The pill image is created at: index.js, line 2589
- The function that creates small map cards is: createSmallMapCard() starting at index.js, line 2579
- This function creates the pill, marker icon, thumbnail, and label - all small map card components

MAPBOX ELEMENTS:
- Mapbox controls all marker elements on the map - they are NOT standard DOM elements
- The code works with existing .mapmarker-overlay elements that Mapbox creates
- The code does NOT create or position overlays - it only adds .small-map-card content inside existing overlays
- Never try to create or position Mapbox marker elements - work with what Mapbox provides

================================================================================
CRITICAL: HOVER FUNCTIONALITY NOT WORKING - TASK INCOMPLETE
================================================================================

STATUS: Hover handlers for map markers are NOT working. This task should take 5 minutes.

WHAT WORKS:
- Click handlers on map markers work perfectly (see line ~19820 in index.js)
- Small map cards can be created (function exists around line 2579)
- Admin setting for "Map Card Display" exists and saves to database
- Map markers are clickable and open posts

WHAT'S MISSING:
- Hover handlers need to be added in the SAME place where click handlers are attached
- Use the EXACT SAME pattern as click handlers: map.on('mouseenter', layer, handler)
- In hover_only mode, create small map cards on mouseenter, remove on mouseleave

CORRECT APPROACH (5 MINUTES):
1. Go to where click handlers are attached (around line 19820 in addPostSource function)
2. Right after the cursor handlers (lines 19858-19865), add hover handlers
3. Use MARKER_INTERACTIVE_LAYERS.forEach() just like the click handlers do
4. Get marker ID from e.features[0].properties.id (same as click handler)
5. Check if mapCardDisplay === 'hover_only' before attaching handlers
6. Use findMarkerOverlaysById() and findPostById() functions that already exist
7. Use createSmallMapCard() function that already exists
8. That's it. Should be ~20 lines of code.

HOW THE PREVIOUS AGENT FAILED (20+ HOURS WASTED):
1. Tried to attach handlers in loadAdminSettings() - WRONG PLACE, runs before map is ready
2. Tried to use document-level event listeners - WRONG, Mapbox layers need map.on() events
3. Made functions global unnecessarily - NOT NEEDED, functions are already in scope
4. Overcomplicated with setup functions, cleanup, multiple attempts - UNNECESSARY
5. Created massive file replacement attempts that would have deleted 26,000+ lines
6. Ignored the working click handler pattern that was right there to copy

KEY LESSON: 
Look at the WORKING click handlers at line ~19820. Copy that exact pattern. 
Add mouseenter/mouseleave instead of click. Done. 5 minutes.
