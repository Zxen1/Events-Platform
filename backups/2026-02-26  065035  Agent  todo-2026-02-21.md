# FunMap To Do List
Created: 21 February 2026

---

## 1. Email Verification — Inline Animated Button
Inline animated verify-email button on the registration form. Sends verification email when clicked. Button spins while waiting. Turns green when user clicks the link in their email. Unlocks the submit button. The form stays open throughout — user never leaves the page.

---

## 2. Email Templates
Create all templates in the `admin_messages` table under `msg_email`. Required emails:
1. Welcome / registration confirmation
2. New post live — details + edit link
3. Post upgraded — confirmation
4. Payment receipt (covers donation, new post, upgrade)
5. Password reset
6. Deletion confirmation (post or account)
7. 7-day expiry warning — sent once per member, lists all posts expiring within the next 14 days (batched, no daily hounding)
8. Post expired notice — batched daily per member

All sent from `support@funmap.com`.

---

## 3. Buttons Site-Wide
Audit all buttons. Decide whether subtle soft-3D styling is appropriate and consistent with the brand. User leans toward keeping it. Confirm decision then apply consistently across the entire site.

---

## ~~4. Icons~~
~~Replace current icons in postcards and post views with better ones throughout the site.~~

---

## 5. Categories & Subcategories
Streamline the full category and subcategory list. Remove any subcategories with zero worldwide results in the filter panel. Ensure every subcategory has the correct fieldsets assigned.

---

## 6. Payment Currency
Confirm Stripe and PayPal are charging in USD. Understand how Stripe converts to AUD before depositing to bank account. Clarify how this appears in reporting and reconciliation.

---

## 7. Responsive Design
Test and fix layout on iPhone, Android, tablets, and various desktop sizes. Decide on a strategy for landscape phone orientation.

---

## 8. Password Recovery
Design and implement a password recovery flow.

---

## 9. Coupon Codes
Allow free or discounted post creation via coupon codes — for testing, friends, and promotions.

---

## 10. Post Status Bars
Add status bars to posts appropriate to the active sort order. Examples: countdown to start date for events. Verify all existing sort orders work correctly. Consider a new sort order for deals and promos.

---

## ~~11. Buy Now Button~~
~~Add a configurable Buy Now / Shop Now / Tickets button per post, linking to an external ticket, item, or shop page.~~

---

## ~~12. Formbuilder — Subcategory Auto-Fill~~
~~Ensure subcategory fieldsets are auto-populated correctly in Formbuilder based on subcategory type (events vs general).~~

---

## 20. Storefront / Entries System
Multiple posts at the same address by the same member should merge into a storefront. Member avatar becomes the group thumbnail. Support multiple cities per storefront. Consider bulk pricing discounts for storefront members.

---

## 13. Tier Colours
Decide on dedicated colours for Standard / Featured / Premium tiers and apply them consistently throughout the site (buttons, borders, checkout, post editor tabs, etc.).

---

## 14. Moderation System
Design and implement the full moderation system.

---

## 15. Update Sitemap
Update `sitemap.html` to reflect the current state of the platform.

---

## 16. SEO & Social Sharing
Ensure all imagery, icons, logos, descriptions, and meta tags look correct when links are shared on Facebook, Instagram, and elsewhere.

---

## 17. Data Population
Integrate Ticketmaster Open Events API and other legal data sources to populate subcategories with real content. Consider daily scheduled scrapes. Review whether new fieldsets are needed (e.g. opening hours).

---

## 18. Test Posts Audit
Check every fieldset renders correctly in post view. Amenities not yet implemented. Other fieldsets need review to ensure they display correctly.

---

## 21. Single-Use Invite Codes
Each code is tied to one specific email address and expires after one use. If someone else tries it, it simply doesn't work. Separate system from coupon codes — intended for granting complimentary access to friends or companies without the risk of a code spreading publicly.

---

## 19. Growth Plan
Evaluate SEO strategy for major world events. Consider a Facebook page with auto-posted new listings. Research influencer vs paid advertising options that are not extremely expensive.
