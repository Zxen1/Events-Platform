MOBILE SCROLLING FINDINGS - CRITICAL FOR NEXT AGENT
====================================================

PROBLEM:
- iOS Safari in portrait mode shows browser UI (address bar, toolbar) that takes ~20% of screen
- The safe area at top shows black bar blocking content
- Landscape mode works fine - gives 100% screen coverage
- Safari only hides its UI when the user scrolls

WHAT WORKS:
1. Making body scrollable triggers Safari to collapse its UI
2. Header with position: relative scrolls off screen correctly
3. Panels pushing header up works
4. The top safe area black bar disappears when scrolling is enabled
5. Map can extend to all edges with viewport-fit=cover

KEY CSS CHANGES AT MOBILE (530px breakpoint):

1. body:
   - overflow-y: scroll
   - height: auto
   - min-height: 0

2. header-bar:
   - position: relative (not fixed)
   - padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top)
   - height: calc(var(--header-h, 56px) + env(safe-area-inset-top))

3. map-area:
   - position: fixed
   - top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0
   - height: auto

4. post-panel and recent-panel:
   - position: relative
   - height: auto

5. post-panel-content and recent-panel-content:
   - position: relative
   - top: auto
   - height: auto

STILL NEEDS WORK:
- Need scrollable content to trigger Safari UI collapse
- Red test line (body::before, position: fixed, z-index: 9999) used for testing
- Bottom of screen may still have issues
- Panels need to work with scrolling properly

VIEWPORT META TAG:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover">

The viewport-fit=cover is essential for extending into safe areas.

IMPORTANT:
- All changes must be inside @media (max-width: 530px)
- Desktop must remain unaffected
- Map must remain interactive (Mapbox handles its own touch events)
