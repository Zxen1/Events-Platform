UPDATE `post_map_cards` SET `description` = 'The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge spanning Sydney Harbour, connecting the Sydney central business district to the North Shore. Nicknamed "the Coathanger" because of its arch-based design, the bridge carries eight lanes of road traffic, two railway lines, a footway, and a cycleway. It is one of the most photographed landmarks in Australia.

The bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long of Middlesbrough and opened in 1932 after eight years of construction. At the time of its completion, it was the world''s widest long-span bridge and remains the world''s largest steel arch bridge, with the top of the arch standing 134 metres above the harbour.

Visitors can climb to the summit of the bridge through the BridgeClimb experience, which offers spectacular 360-degree views of Sydney Harbour, the Opera House, and the city skyline. The Pylon Lookout museum within the southeast pylon provides exhibits about the bridge''s construction and history.
