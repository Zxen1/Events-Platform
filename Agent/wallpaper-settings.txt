LOCATION WALLPAPER SETTINGS
===========================

Four modes: Off, Still, Basic, Orbit


OFF
---
No wallpaper. Default container background.


STILL
-----
Single static map image. Captured once, no animation.


BASIC
-----
4 pan images from N/E/S/W, pure CSS animation after initial capture.

CAPTURE:
- Width: container + 100px
- Height: container + 300px
- Anchor: top-left
- 4 images captured sequentially (5s apart to avoid system load)

CAMERA SETTINGS:
| Type          | Zoom | Pitch | Bearings        |
|---------------|------|-------|-----------------|
| Venue/Address | 16   | 70°   | 0, 90, 180, 270 |
| City          | 11   | 70°   | 0, 90, 180, 270 |

ANIMATION:
- Slide duration: 20 seconds per image
- Pan: 100px leftward over 20 seconds (5px/sec)
- Crossfade: 1.5 seconds (matches marquee)
- Full cycle: 80 seconds (4 images × 20s)

CONTAINER GROWTH:
- 300px height buffer handles most growth without stretching
- If growth exceeds buffer: image stretches temporarily
- Re-capture happens while ANOTHER image is visible (never current)
- Fresh image ready for next cycle

NETWORK:
- Initial: 4 Mapbox requests (spaced 5s apart)
- After: zero network activity unless container grows 300px+


ORBIT
-----
Live Mapbox GL JS rendering. Camera orbits location continuously.
Highest quality, highest resource usage.
