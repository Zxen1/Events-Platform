LOCATION WALLPAPER COMPONENT
============================

Standalone component. Reads lat/lng from context (posts: post_map_cards table, forms: Google Places inputs). No dedicated lat/lng inputs. Insertable anywhere, any container size.


MAP ARCHITECTURE
----------------

Main map        Spinning globe, clusters, always visible
Secondary map   All wallpaper captures AND orbit rendering

Rule: NEVER more than 2 live maps. Queue system prevents third map.

Secondary map location:
  Lives in components-new.js as SecondaryMap utility
  Persistent - created once, reused for all captures
  Any component can request via SecondaryMap.capture(camera, w, h, callback)
  Queue handles multiple requests, eliminates WebGL stutter


IMAGE STORAGE
-------------

Location: Map images folder (not hardcoded to any CDN)
Priority: Fetch existing images first, only generate if not found
Dimensions: 700x2500 pixels (fixed)
Bearings: N(0), E(90), S(180), W(270)


POSITIONING
-----------

Vertical: Image center positioned below container header (currently 300px, configurable)
Horizontal: Still/Orbit centered, Basic left-anchored (configurable)

Container growth handling:
  - 2500px height accommodates most containers without stretch
  - As container grows, image stays in place
  - When image bottom reaches container footer, bottom anchors to footer
  - Only stretches if container exceeds 2500px (rare)
  - Never black bars


USER PREFERENCE
---------------

Priority:
  1. Member's animation_preference (members/admins table)
  2. localStorage (guests)
  3. Admin default (new users)

Setting location: Member profile (Map Settings section)
Options: Off, Still, Basic, Orbit


MODES
-----

OFF
  Nothing displayed

STILL
  Single north-facing image, horizontally centered
  Fade in 1.5s

BASIC
  All 4 images (N/E/S/W)
  Left-anchored, pans leftward (currently 100px over 20s, configurable)
  Additive dissolve: next image fades in from 18.5s to 20s (no dip to black)
  Animation never stops unless click outside container
  Click outside: pauses on current frame
  Click back: resumes

ORBIT
  Live SecondaryMap rendering, horizontally centered (never stored)
  Fade in 1.5s
  Click outside: still image fades in 1.5s
  Click back: still fades out 1.5s, orbit reactivates from saved camera


TRANSITIONS
-----------

All elements fade IN 1.5s (additive dissolve, no dip to black)
Exception: still fades OUT when returning to orbit


FORM SUBMISSION
---------------

Generate 4 images only if they don't exist for those coordinates
Store with post images


CONFIGURABLE VALUES
-------------------

These may change based on testing:
  - Image center offset below header (currently 300px)
  - Pan distance (currently 100px)
  - Pan duration (currently 20s)
  - Pan direction (currently leftward)
  - Dissolve timing (currently 18.5s-20s, may extend if glitches occur)


CSS CLASSES
-----------

.component-locationwallpaper
.component-locationwallpaper-container
.component-locationwallpaper-content
.component-locationwallpaper-content--active
.component-locationwallpaper-mapmount
.component-locationwallpaper-image
.component-locationwallpaper-basic-container
.component-locationwallpaper-basic-image
.component-locationwallpaper-basic-image--active
@keyframes locationwallpaper-basic-pan

Lat/lng read from context using .fieldset-lat / .fieldset-lng (no dedicated component classes)


JS UTILITIES
------------

SecondaryMap.capture(camera, w, h, cb)  - Queue a capture request
WallpaperCache.get/put/getAll/putAll    - IndexedDB image cache


FUTURE
------

This is one wallpaper type. More may be added.
Auto-detection (connection speed, memory, battery) may force mode downgrade.
