UPDATE post_map_cards SET description = 'The Panthéon-Benou00eet Prieur-Panthu00e9on.wav","classes":", from Ancient Greek πάνειον (pántheion) \' to all the gods\') is a monument in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, France. It stands in the Latin Quarter (Quartier latin), atop the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, in the centre of the Place du Panthéon, which was named after it. The edifice was built between 1758 and 1790, from designs by Jacques-Germain Soufflot, at the behest of King Louis XV; the king intended it as a church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, Paris\'s patron saint, whose relics were to be housed in the church. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV lived to see the church completed.

By the time the construction was finished, the French Revolution had started; the National Constituent Assembly voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the Pantheon in Rome which had been used in this way since the 17th century. The first panthéonisé was Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, although his remains were removed from the building a few years later. The Panthéon was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th centuryalthough Soufflot\'s remains were transferred inside it in 1829until the French Third Republic finally decreed the building\'s exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881. The placement of Victor Hugo\'s remains in the crypt in 1885 was its first entombment in over 50 years.

The market\'s character, location, and size have all changed over time. Amidst Joseon\'s isolationism in the 16th and 17th centuries, the market was limited to mostly Korean customers and merchants. This persisted until the Empire of Japan forcefully opened Korea in the JapanKorea Treaty of 1876. Afterwards, nearly half of the merchants became either ethnic Chinese or Japanese merchants. During the 19101945 Japanese colonial period, the market survived a number of attempts by the Japanese colonial government to shut it down. The market was destroyed a number of times over time by accidental fires, including one during the 19501953 Korean War. Each time it was destroyed, it was rebuilt to roughly the same size and status it had previously operated under.
