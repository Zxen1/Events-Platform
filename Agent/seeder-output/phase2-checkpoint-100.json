      "description": "The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings, and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.\n\nDesigned by Danish architect Jørn Utzon and completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973, 16 years after Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.\n\nPhoto: Bernard Spragg.

      "description": "The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, spanning Sydney Harbour from the central business district (CBD) to the North Shore. The view of the bridge, the Harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. Nicknamed \"the Coathanger\" because of its arch-based design, the bridge carries rail, vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.\n\nUnder the direction of John Bradfield of the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long of Middlesbrough, and opened in 1932. The bridge's general design, which Bradfield tasked the NSW Department of Public Works with producing, was a rough copy of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. The design chosen from the tender responses was original work created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from its own Tyne Bridge.\n\nPhoto: Bookish Worm (CC BY-SA 4.0); Rodney Haywood (Attribution); JJ Harrison (https://www.jjharrison.com.au/) (CC BY-SA 3.0)",

Designed by the architect George McRae, the Romanesque Revival building was constructed between 1893 and 1898 and is 30 metres (98 ft) wide by 190 metres (620 ft) long. The domes were built by Ritchie Brothers, a steel and metal company that also built trains, trams and farm equipment. The building fills a city block bounded by George, Market, York, and Druitt Streets. Designed as a marketplace, it was used for a variety of other purposes, underwent remodelling, and suffered decay until its restoration and return to its original use in the late twentieth century. The property is co-owned by the City of Sydney and Link REIT, and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010.\n\nPhoto: Sardaka (talk) 08:15, 26 November 2010 (UTC) (CC BY 3.0); Maksym Kozlenko (CC BY-SA 3.0); Tirin also known as Takver - www.takver.com (CC BY-SA 3.0)",

The 267,954-hectare (662,130-acre) national park is situated approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the Sydney CBD, and the park boundary is quite irregular as it is broken up by roads, urban areas and areas of private property. Despite the name mountains, the area is an uplifted plateau, dissected by a number of larger rivers. The highest point in the park is Mount Werong at 1,215 metres (3,986 ft) above sea level; while the low point is on the Nepean River at 20 metres (66 ft) above sea level as it leaves the park.\n\nThe national park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Greater Blue Mountains was one of 15 World Heritage places included in the National Heritage List on 21 May 2007. The Blue Mountains National Park is the most central of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site and it forms part of the Great Dividing Range. The park is also listed on the Australian Heritage Register and the overall complex of Blue Mountains regional walking tracks is listed on the State Heritage Register.\n\nPhoto: Visions of Domino (CC BY 2.0); TomGonzales (CC BY-SA 3.0); Adam.J.W.C.

The MCG is within walking distance of the Melbourne CBD and is served by Richmond and Jolimont railway stations, as well as the route 70, 75 and 48 trams. It is adjacent to Melbourne Park and is an integral part of the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct.\n\nSince it was built in 1853, the MCG has undergone numerous renovations. It served as the main stadium for the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games, as well as hosting two Cricket World Cup finals: 1992 and 2015. Noted for its role in the development of international cricket, the MCG hosted both the first Test match and the first One Day International, played between Australia and England in 1877 and 1971, respectively. It has also maintained strong ties with Australian rules football since its codification in 1859, and has become the principal venue for Australian Football League (AFL) matches, including the AFL Grand Final, the world's highest attended league championship event.\n\nPhoto: Unknown authorUnknown author (Public domain); PaddyBriggs at English Wikipedia (Public domain); Jason L (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

      "description": "The Shrine of Remembrance is a war memorial in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, located in Kings Domain on St Kilda Road. It was built to honour the men and women of Victoria who served in World War I, but now functions as a memorial to all Australians who have served in any war. It is a site of annual observances for Anzac Day (25 April) and Remembrance Day (11 November), and is one of the largest war memorials in Australia.\n\nDesigned by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop, both World War I veterans, the Shrine is in classical style, based on the Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. The crowning element at the top of the ziggurat roof references the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. Built from Tynong granite, the Shrine originally consisted only of the central sanctuary surrounded by the ambulatory. The sanctuary contains the marble Stone of Remembrance, upon which is engraved the words \"Greater love hath no man\"John15:13\" class\"extiw external\" title\"s:Bible (King James)John\"John 15:13); once per year, on 11 November at 11 a.m. (Remembrance Day), a ray of sunlight shines through an aperture in the roof to light up the word \"Love\" in the inscription. Beneath the sanctuary lies the crypt, which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son, and panels listing every unit of the Australian Imperial Force.\n\nPhoto: Jorge Láscar from Australia (CC BY 2.0); Shkuru Afshar (CC BY-SA 4.0); Gnangarra (CC BY 2.5 au)",

It is also Australia's busiest public library and, as of 2023, the third busiest library globally.\n\nThe library has remained on the same site in the central business district since it was established fronting Swanston Street, and over time has expanded to cover a block bounded also by La Trobe, Russell, and Little Lonsdale streets. The library's collection consists of over five million items, which in addition to books includes manuscripts, paintings, maps, photographs and newspapers, with a special focus on material from Victoria, including the diaries of the European founders of present-day Melbourne John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, the folios of colonial explorer James Cook, and items related to Ned Kelly, notably his armour and the original Jerilderie Letter.\n\nPhoto: Diliff (CC BY 2.5); Crisco 1492 (CC BY-SA 4.0); Unknown authorUnknown author (Public domain)",

Winding through varying terrain along the coast, and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction.\n\nThe city of Geelong, close to Torquay, experiences great benefit from Australian and international visitors to the road, with Geelong Otway Tourism affirming it as an invaluable asset. In 2008, the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) listed the road as the state's top tourism experience in its Victoria 101 survey, based on places that members of the public would recommend to visitors.\n\nPhoto: Bobak Ha'Eri (CC BY 3.0); Diliff (CC BY-SA 3.0); Grace Tarbuck (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

It is located adjacent to King George Square, where the rectangular City Hall has its main entrance. The City Hall also has frontages and entrances in both Ann Street and Adelaide Street. The building design is based on a combination of the Roman Pantheon, and St Mark's Campanile in Venice and is considered one of Brisbane's finest buildings. It was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1978 and on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992. It is also iconic for its Westminster chimes which sound on the quarter-hour.\n\nThe building has been used for royal receptions, pageants, orchestral concerts, the Lord Mayor's Seniors Christmas Concerts, civic greetings, flower shows, school graduations and political meetings. In 2008, it was discovered that the building had severe structural problems. After a three-year restoration, it re-opened on 6 April 2013.\n\nPhoto: Chris Olszewski (CC BY-SA 4.0); Cathetus at English Wikipedia (Public domain); Chris Olszewski (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

      "description": "The Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as the Gabba, is a major sports stadium in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, Australia. The nickname Gabba derives from the suburb of Woolloongabba, in which it is located. Over the years, the Gabba has hosted athletics, Australian rules football, baseball, concerts, cricket, cycling, rugby league, rugby union, Association football and pony and greyhound racing. At present, it serves as the home ground for the Queensland Bulls in domestic cricket, the Brisbane Heat of the Big Bash League and Women's Big Bash League, and the Brisbane Lions of the Australian Football League.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2005, the Gabba was redeveloped in six stages at a cost of A128,000,000. The dimensions of the playing field are now 170.6 metres (560 feet) (east-west) by 149.9 metres (492 feet) (north-south), to accommodate the playing of Australian rules football at elite level. The seating capacity of the ground was 42,000 in 2010, which has been reduced in recent times due to new electronic scoreboards and corporate facilities. For international cricket matches, the capacity is reduced to 36,000 due to new scoreboards and the addition of a pool deck, as well as wider sight screens. For AFL matches the capacity is slightly larger at 37,478.\n\nPhoto: Rae Allen (CC BY 2.0); Talisen (CC BY 2.0); The original uploader was Ryanlerch at English Wikipedia. (Public domain)",

A popular recreation spot, especially for climbing and running, they are conveniently close to the city and the South Bank Parklands. The cliffs can be accessed by footpath from South Bank Parklands, Kangaroo Point Green Bridge or the Story Bridge, and also via ferry to either Holman Street or Maritime Museum ferry terminals. The cliffs were formed after stone was quarried from the site and used in the construction of a number of local structures in the Moreton Bay penal settlement.\n\nPhoto: MrGeneric3319 (CC BY 4.0)",

      "description": "Brisbane Stadium (Lang Park), currently known as Suncorp Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose stadium in the suburb of Milton, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Nicknamed The Cauldron, it is a three-tiered rectangular sporting stadium with a capacity of 52,500. The traditional home of rugby league in Brisbane, the modern stadium is also now used for rugby union and soccer and has a rectangular playing field of 136 by 82 metres (446 by 269 ft). The stadium's major tenants are the Brisbane Broncos, the Dolphins, the Brisbane Roar, the Queensland Maroons and the Queensland Reds.\n\nLang Park was established in 1914, on the site of the former North Brisbane Cemetery; in its early days it was home to a number of different sports, including cycling, athletics and soccer. The lease of the park was taken over by the Brisbane Rugby League in 1957, before it became the home of the game in Queensland (remaining so to this day). It has also been the home ground of major rugby union and soccer matches in Queensland since its modern redevelopment, including the Queensland Reds and the Brisbane Roar, as well as some Wallabies, Matildas and Socceroos matches. It hosted the 2008 and 2017 Rugby League World Cup finals, besides the 2021 NRL Grand Final. In addition to this, the ground hosted Rugby World Cup quarter finals and two Super Rugby grand finals, with the Queensland Reds winning on both occasions. The venue hosted several matches for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup including the third-place match, and will host the rugby sevens and soccer tournaments at the 2032 Summer Olympics, including the gold medal matches in both the men's and women's soccer events.\n\nPhoto: MarioBayo (CC BY-SA 4.0); Chris Olszewski (CC BY-SA 4.0); Qld matt at en.wikipedia (Public domain)",

      "description": "Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary is a heritage-listed zoological garden at 28 Tomewin Street, Currumbin, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1947 onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009. The sanctuary is world-renowned for its feeding of huge flocks of free-flying wild rainbow lorikeets, which come to the sanctuary to feast off the special mixture which the lorikeets eat.\n\nThe sanctuary was opened in 1947 by Alex Griffiths as the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary, originally intended to divert local lorikeets from damaging his flower crops. It has since become a major nature-based tourist attraction, known for daily lorikeet feeding and one of the largest collections of Australian native species in the world. The site includes a miniature railway (operating since 1964), a wildlife hospital, and newer exhibits such as the Lost Valley precinct, which opened in 2017.\n\nPhoto: Lewi Hirvela (CC BY-SA 2.0); Shiftchange (CC0); Brian0918 (CC BY-SA 2.5)",

The 6,197-hectare (15,310-acre) park is situated on the McPherson Range, near Springbrook, approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) south of Brisbane. The park is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.\n\nIn December 1994, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee officially extended the area now known as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area over the Scenic Rim (including Main Range, Mount Barney, Lamington, and Springbrook National Parks, and Goomburra Forest Reserve) and the rainforests of northern New South Wales. In 2007 the areas of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia were added to the Australian National Heritage List. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.\n\nPhoto: Knödelbaum (CC BY-SA 3.0); Yulanlu97 (CC BY-SA 4.0); Mike Young (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

A sandy, low-lying island formed on a base of aeolianite limestone, Rottnest is an A-class reserve, the highest level of protection afforded to public land.\n\nTogether with Garden Island, Rottnest Island is a remnant of Pleistocene dune ridges. Along with several other islands, Rottnest became separated from the mainland when sea levels rose around 7,000 years ago. The traditional Noongar name for the island is Wadjemup, which means \"place across the water where the spirits are\". Human artefacts have been found on the island dating back at least 30,000 years, but visitation and habitation of the island by the Noongar people appears to have ceased following its separation from the mainland.\n\nPhoto: Pedro Szekely from Los Angeles, USA (CC BY-SA 2.0); Hesperian (CC BY 3.0); Nestek (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

      "description": "Fremantle Prison, sometimes referred to as Fremantle Gaol or Fremantle Jail, is a former Australian prison and World Heritage Site in Fremantle, Western Australia. The site includes the prison cellblocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, and tunnels. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused 1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison.\n\nThe prison was administered by a comptroller general, sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system in Western Australia, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were present in large numbers.\n\nPhoto: Gnangarra (CC BY 2.5 au); Ghostieguide at English Wikipedia (Public domain); Henry Wray (Public domain)",

Established on 20 June 1899, two years before Australia's Federation in 1901, the Perth Mint was the last of three Australian colonial branches of the United Kingdom's Royal Mint intended to refine gold from the gold rushes and to mint gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns for the British Empire. Along with the Royal Australian Mint, which produces coins of the Australian dollar for circulation, the Perth Mint is the older of Australia's two mints issuing coins that are legal tender.\n\nPhoto: Chris Olszewski (CC BY-SA 4.0); Bruxton (CC BY-SA 4.0); Chris Olszewski (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

Additionally, the island is also protected by the Penguin Island Conservation Park, which was established in 1918 and has a size of 11 hectares (27 acres).\n\nPhoto: Calistemon (CC BY-SA 4.0); Scoreed (CC BY 2.5); Brian Jenkins (Attribution)",

The zoo's most recent enclosures are in the second phase of the South-East Asia exhibit, known as Immersion, providing visitors with the experience of walking through the jungle, with Sumatran tigers and Sumatran orangutans seemingly within reach. Five buildings within the zoo have been listed as state heritage places on the South Australian Heritage Register, including the front entrance on Frome Road and the former Elephant House. The zoo is also a botanical garden and the grounds contain significant exotic and native flora, including a Moreton Bay fig planted in 1877.\n\nPhoto: Bilby (CC BY 3.0); Bilby (CC BY 3.0); Michał Rosa (CC BY-SA 3.0)",

The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, separated from the coast by a channel 160 kilometres (100 mi) wide in places and over 61 metres (200 ft) deep. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997. Australian World Heritage places included it in its list in 2007. The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland in 2006.\n\nA large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff of humanmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study which found over half of the reef's coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified.\n\nPhoto: NASA/Kjell Lindgren (Public domain); Unknown (CC BY-SA 3.0); Luka Peternel (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

Constructed in 1891, the line runs from Cairns, Queensland, over the Great Dividing Range to the town of Kuranda on the Atherton Tableland. The route passes through the Macalister Range, as well as the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater and Redlynch.\n\nThe railway line is 37 km (23 mi) in length. While this service is the predominant use of the line, it is still used for some freight and other passenger services including The Savannahlander. It operates daily throughout the year, with the exception of Christmas Day. A one-way trip takes approximately one hour and 55 minutes.\n\nPhoto: SHB2000 (CC BY-SA 4.0); Jls444 (CC BY-SA 3.0)",

      "description": "Battery Point is a suburb of the city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. It is immediately south of the central business district. It is in the local government area of City of Hobart.\n\nBattery Point is named after the battery of guns which were established on the point in 1818 as part of the Hobart coastal defences. The battery was situated on the site of today's Princes Park. The guns were used to fire salutes on ceremonial occasions but were never called upon to repel an invasion. The battery was decommissioned after an 1878 review of Hobart's defences found that its location would tend to draw an enemy's fire onto the surrounding residential neighbourhood. The site was subsequently handed over to the Hobart City Council as a place of recreation and amusement. When the Council carried out works to beautify the park in 1934, they discovered tunnels which had served as a magazine for the original battery. In 1973, a green ban was placed by the Builders Labourers Federation to prevent destruction of certain buildings by developers.\n\nPhoto: StAnselm (Public domain); JERRYE &amp; ROY KLOTZ MD (CC BY-SA 3.0)",

      "description": "Freycinet National Park is a national park on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, 125 kilometres (78 mi) northeast of Hobart. It occupies a large part of the Freycinet Peninsula, named after French navigator Louis de Freycinet, and Schouten Island. Founded in 1916, it is Tasmania's oldest park, along with Mount Field National Park. Bordering the national park is the small settlement of Coles Bay, and the largest nearby town is Swansea. Freycinet contains part of the rugged Tasmanian coastline and includes the secluded Wineglass Bay. Features of the park include its red and pink granite formations and a series of jagged granite peaks in a line, called \"The Hazards\".\n\nBecause of the range of rare and endemic flora and fauna species present, as well as the diversity of landscapes and communities at Freycinet National Park, its role in conservation is particularly significant. The area within the park is also of cultural importance, with many Aboriginal and European sites protected, though deeper investigation into human history within the park still needs to be undertaken. Large sections of the park remain undisturbed by humans, including parts of the catchment and the landscape.\n\nPhoto: aussiejeff from Perth, WA, Australia (CC BY-SA 2.0); Jane6592 (CC BY-SA 4.0); Wanderingturtle (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

It is run by Auckland Council with the Zoological Society of Auckland as a supporting organisation.\n\nAuckland Zoo opened in 1922, experiencing early difficulties mainly due to animal health issues. By 1930 a sizeable collection of animals had been assembled and a zoological society formed. The zoo consolidated during the Second World War and was at that time under the leadership of Lt. Col. Sawer. After the war the collection was expanded. In the 1950s, chimpanzees were acquired to provide tea parties for the public's entertainment, but this practice ceased in 1964. In 1973 the zoo expanded into the adjacent Western Springs Park. From the late 1980s to the present day, many old exhibits were phased out and replaced by modern enclosures. In 2011 the zoo opened its largest development, Te Wao Nui, which exhibits native New Zealand flora and fauna.\n\nPhoto: Zoophilia at English Wikipedia (Public domain); Jorge Royan (CC BY-SA 3.0); Avenue (CC BY-SA 3.0)",

Its ferry terminal in Matiatia Bay at the western end is 21.5 km (13.4 mi) from the central-city terminal in Auckland.\n\nIt is the most populated island in the gulf, with 9,100 permanent residents, and the third most populous island in New Zealand (behind the two main islands). An additional estimated 3,400 people have second homes or holiday homes on the island. It is more densely populated than the North and South Islands. It is the most accessible island in the gulf, with regular passenger and car-ferry services, a helicopter operator based on the island, and other air links.\n\nPhoto: Ingolfson (Public domain); Tomwsulcer (Public domain); IcknieldRidgeway (CC BY-SA 4.0)",
