MAPMARKER REQUIREMENTS
======================

1. Mapmarker icons use the posts subcategory icons at 30x30 (except multi post)

2. Hovering on a mapmarker changes it to 30x30 thumbnail (except multi post)

3. The centre of the mapmarker is at latlng and never reloads to prevent flicker

4. When a mapmarker is clicked, it animate grows to 50x50 thumbnail or multi post icon

5. There is zero delay when changing hover state of mapmarkers and there is no need to move into a blank area to reset

6. There must be only one source of truth for hover/click triggers and that must be the mapmarker or map card.

7. Map cards are just decorations that sit behind the mapmarkers. The z-indexes for all components should be listed in the zindex table of style.css

8. Ask questions every step of the way to add to this list. Never guess. Do not name functions or anything before asking what to name things.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
=====================

- Map cards will be dealt with AFTER mapmarkers are working properly
- Everything will be sprite-based to avoid DOM conflicts and flickering
- Preload all icons and map card pills once at the beginning of first map load for faster/smoother loading
- Function names: prefix all with "mapmarker" (e.g., mapmarkerInit, mapmarkerHandleHover, etc.)

Z-INDEX ORDER (from bottom to top):
- map = 0
- base pill = 5
- accent pill = 10
- small map card label = 15
- big map card label = 20
- mapmarker icon = 25
- mapmarker thumbnail = 30

MULTI-POST MARKERS:
- Always use multi-post icon (never thumbnails)
- Simply grow from 30px to 50px on click
- No thumbnail switching for multi-post markers
